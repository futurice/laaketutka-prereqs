Most interesting stuff in this repository is probably the drug and symptom dictionaries in the processed data folder. These files were produced with word_collector.py.

University affiliated researchers can download raw Suomi24 datasets from Kielipankki. If you are a university affiliated researcher, please contact us to get access to preprocessing scripts used with Suomi24 data. Unfortunately we can't release those scripts publicly. If you wish to work with some other dataset and you need help setting up, also contact us! This repo has a mock_data.json file to show roughly what the expected format should be.
